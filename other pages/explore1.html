          such as your work experiences which are over the past 10 years. Include

          to identify significant information about you. Include short phrases 
          which are related to the job position you are applying for. Including

          as well as the significant accomplishments that you have done in your 
          previous job. Make it simple and short but it must be unique and at the 
          same time strong to give your employer an idea of the things that you can 
          do and offer to them as an employee.

        <h2 class="steps">Tip #5: Always double-check your resume</h2>
        <span class="paragraph"
          >Before submitting your resume always make sure that it is concise 
          and that you have followed the standard and updated format in building 
          your resume. Check all the things you have included, especially the grammar, 
          the structure, and the context of your resume. Make sure to double-check or 
          even triple-check your resume and have someone proofread it first or use a 
          proofreading application just to be sure.
