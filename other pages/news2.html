          >Imagine a typical work life. You wake up early, take the morning commute, get stuck in traffic, 
          and go to your work cubicle until the end of your shift. That was how we were shown the usual 
          work setup. But with the introduction of technology in the workplace, work shifts have 
          shifted (pun intended) to including online or work from home for their employees’ work schedules. 
          <br><br>
          Such hybrid setups have grown in popularity, especially because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
          Because technology has become widely available, workers can now set up their own offices at 
          home without sacrificing the quality of their work. It’s not something that companies are 
          trying to avoid as well but is becoming more open to the idea of letting their employees adopt 
          these flexible working arrangements. 
          <br><br>
          What’s the appeal you might ask, and there’s a long list of reasons for that. Aside 
          from the obvious reasons of flexibility and cost-effectiveness because of the lack of 
          everyday commuting, a hybrid work set-up also helps with balancing one’s work life, a wider 
          hiring pool, better mental health and time management, and higher employee satisfaction.
          <br><br>
          But just like with everything, it has its own downsides. For starters, not everyone 
          has the means to set up their own offices at home. There is also a problem with 
          collaboration and team rapport when employees don’t see each other as often. 
          There is also a need for better maintenance and security, especially when work 
          goes online and becomes vulnerable to outside threats.
          <br><br>
          However, even with these risks, a high number of job seekers are more attracted 
          to the idea of working in a hybrid set-up, with a survey finding out that almost half 
          of them would actively seek another job should the one they’re applying for not offer it. 
          Because of this, some surveys have found that up to 77% of companies have shifted to such 
          a set-up and up to 80% of employees are advocating for their own companies to also take 
          the leap and shift into this new set-up.
          <br><br>
          Now, although shifting is not as easy as it seems, it is not something that companies 
          are avoiding. Another survey found that 66% of organizations have already fully shifted 
          into this setup, and a whopping 30% of the organizations that didn’t are already actively shifting.
          <br><br>
          The question now is will it fully replace traditional work set-ups? Probably not, but with the 
          recent application of technology in the workplace, it might just become the dominant work 
          environment in the near future. Only time will tell if this will continue to evolve and 
          spread its influence in the workplace.
