          >In previous decades, securing a job often meant that you worked under a specific group, 
          company, or organization. However, in recent years, freelancers, or independent workers 
          who work on a per-job basis have seen a rise in the industry. A study conducted by 
          ClearlyRated shows that the majority of Gen Z and Millenials are more inclined to work 
          as freelancers as opposed to working under a certain company. 
          <br><br>
          Now the question is why? Well, surveys and research have shown that in recent years, 
          people are more attracted to the idea of having flexible hours and workloads. 
          They have the option to work on what they want and when they want to do it, giving 
          them more freedom to do what they want in their daily lives as opposed to working in 
          fixed shifts of 9-5, six days a week. Not only that but having flexible hours in 
          working helps them to also have the option of working from home. 
          <br><br>
          Another major reason why this is happening is because workers are choosing to have 
          better control over their work lives. Freelancing basically means that you are your 
          own manager and boss, stating what you need to do and how to do it. Though it may seem 
          like a lot of work, studies show that freelancing can help with individual growth and 
          experience in their career. It helps them achieve this at their own pace and their own time.
          <br><br>
          Does this mean that this will negatively affect the traditional companies we have 
          in the workforce? Very unlikely. Instead, it is providing more work opportunities for 
          individuals as the workforce has now also been more open to hiring freelancers to do 
          certain jobs. Though it is not to say that freelancing is a stable job, it has its 
          risks as well. Freelancing may be flexible, but salary is dependent on the project 
          at hand. You also are not covered by the usual employee benefits that those who work 
          in the office receive, such as insurance.
          <br><br>
          Freelancing is a viable and hot option for work, but one must always consider 
          the pros and cons when choosing to work freelance.
