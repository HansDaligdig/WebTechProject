          >Does anyone like going to interviews? Having to sit across someone as they 
          come and judge your every move and evaluate everything you say more often 
          than not causes us to be riddled with anxiety and nervousness as we work 
          to give the best impression. And that’s normal, especially when your career 
          depends on it. But how exactly can you improve on how you handle these 
          interviews in the future? Well, here are a few tips and tricks to help 
          you with that.

        <br><br>
        <h2 class="steps">Tip #1: Dress Smart and Carry Yourself Properly</h2>
        <span class="paragraph"
          >Dressing appropriately for the job you’re trying to apply for shows the 
          employer that you put care into how you present yourself to others, especially 
          in a professional setting. However, that is only half the job. Exuding confidence 
          in your posture, body language, and gestures gives the impression that you are a 
          poised person who is prepared for the said interview.

        <h2 class="steps">Tip #2: Set Your Game Plan</h2>
        <span class="paragraph"
          >Getting ready for your interview is not something you can do in under an hour. 
          Preparing for the interview includes an interview plan. First and foremost, 
          you should be familiar with what you wrote in your resume, what the job 
          qualifications are, and the company you are applying for. Next, prepare 
          some mock questions that you believe will be asked by your interviewer. 
          Practice what you are going to say and make sure that you stay honest with 
          those answers. Finally, make sure that you have your clothes prepared and that 
          you get a good night’s rest the day before and eat a heavy meal to ensure that 
          you are attentive and energized for the interview.

        <br><br>
        <h2 class="steps">Tip #3: Mind Your Manners</h2>
        <span class="paragraph"
          >From the moment you step into the interview place, make sure to practice 
          proper courtesy and politeness when greeting your interviewer and any other 
          people that you may encounter during the interview process. This includes 
          proper greeting, being punctual, saying thank you, and in some cases, even bowing. 
          That’s why make sure that you try to research your company and see their 
          basic work etiquette.
        </span>
        <br><br>
        <h2 class="steps">Tip #4: Be Honest and Yourself</h2>
        <span class="paragraph"
          >If there’s one thing that’s a turn-off for interviewers, it’s applicants who 
          are faking it to make it to the top. Now, we always want to give a good and lasting 
          impression on our interviewers, but you must always be the best version of yourself. 
          Showing your genuine self in your actions and words will let the interviewer know 
          what your true intentions are and it will gratefully impact the flow of your interview. 
        </span>
        <br><br>
        <h2 class="steps">Tip #5: Listen!</h2>
        <span class="paragraph"
          >Here’s where that good night’s sleep is going to get into play. 
          During your interview, always listen attentively to your interviewer. 
          Asking questions like “Can you repeat the question?” or “I’m sorry, what 
          was that?” will give the impression that you do not care and are not interested 
          in what they have to say. So always make sure to listen; sit up straight and 
          maintain good eye contact.
        </span>
        <br><br>
        <h2 class="steps">Tip #6: Emphasize Your Strong Points and Get Ready for Questions About Your Weaknesses</h2>
        <span class="paragraph"
          >Just like in every employer, they are seeking the strongest candidates for the job. 
          However, no candidate is perfect, and they all have varying skills and weak points. 
          Think of it as though you’re advertising a product. As an interviewee, you must always 
          point out what you excel in and what you can bring to the table if they choose to hire 
          you. It is inevitable that they will also ask you about what skills you don’t have or 
          lack in. To deal with this question, you must frame that weakness positively. Say 
          that it is a challenge that you are willing to improve upon through training and continuous 
          effort to transform that weakness into a strength.

        <h2 class="steps">Tip #7 Draw the Final Curtain Politely</h2>
        <span class="paragraph"
          >Just like with the positivity you showed when the interview started, you must 
          also bring the same energy at the end of the interview. Reiterate your strong points, 
          thank them for their time, and bid them goodbye with a handshake and a smile. <br><br>
          With these tips, hopefully, it will aid you in acing your upcoming interview or prepare you 
          for the time you will. Just a little bit of effort on your part as the interview will get 
          you one step closer to getting that job. Good luck!
