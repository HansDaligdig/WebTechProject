          >Many often think that once you have found and established your own
          career, that’s where the journey ends. You are now set to sustain your
          own life and there’s no more adventure down the line, but that’s not
          the case. Your career journey spans years as you work to develop
          yourself as a professional in your field of choice. It consists of a
          lot of self-learning and training as you work to better yourself as a
          worker. That’s where career development comes in. <br /><br />
          Career development helps you to improve your skills and productivity
          in your work. It helps you to become motivated, have better morale,
          and better satisfaction in your career. To get started with your own
          career development plan, consider the following steps:
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        <h2 class="steps">1. Assess yourself</h2>
        <span class="paragraph"
          >First and foremost, evaluate your current career situation. Determine
          your current strengths and weaknesses in your technical and soft
          skills. Find out what are your current motivators and inspirations in
          your work life. Point out also what are the challenges you’re
          currently facing with your career.
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        <h2 class="steps">2. Set your goals</h2>
        <span class="paragraph"
          >Once you have done your assessment, write down your goals based on
          what you want to improve and achieve in the future. Maybe it’s a
          promotion or to enhance your techniques; focus on what you need to
          build upon your current situation. Try to plan out both short and
          long-term goals for your career so as to keep yourself motivated on a
          stable plan. Make sure to also note the deadline of these goals,
          whether it be a week, a month, a year, or how long you want, just make
          sure that you know it is doable based on your current capabilities. To
          sum it up, think S.M.A.R.T. (Smart, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,
          and Time-bound) when setting your goals.
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        <h2 class="steps">3. Plan your Course of Action</h2>
        <span class="paragraph"
          >Once you’ve mapped out your goals, plan how you want to start,
          progress, and achieve them. If you don’t mind taking big steps to
          achieve them quickly, go for it, but it is also fine to stick with
          baby steps when working on your goals. Pace yourself accordingly to
          what feels right for you.
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        <h2 class="steps">4. Monitor Your Progress</h2>
        <span class="paragraph"
          >Every step you take toward your goals, even the small ones, make sure
          to keep track of them. It’ll help you time your plans and evaluate
          your current progress. Monitoring what you do will also help you see
          how far you’ve come from where you’ve started. Once you’ve achieved
          said goals, make sure to note them down as well.
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        <h2 class="steps">5. Enjoy What You’re Doing</h2>
        <span class="paragraph">
          With everything you’re doing to work towards your goals, it’s
          important to make sure that you stay motivated and positive into
          improving and adventuring towards your goals. Having a positive
          mindset while going through your career development plan will help you
          stay focused as well as become more productive with what you’re doing.
          <br /><br />
          Career development may seem like a tedious process, but it is worth it
          for an individual’s advancement in their career. It may take a long
          time, but the results are worth the effort and time. The journey of
          learning and improving will take your career to the next level.
