          <h2>What is Career Development?</h2>
          <p class="p-text">
            Career development describes a complicated process of planning
            activities and engagement in one’s career to establish growth in
            their chosen career. Such growth is valuable to both the individual
            and the company as it contributes to the progress of the individual
            in reaching their career objectives through the development of their
            skills, capabilities, decision-making, competence, and
            comprehension. It encompasses the need for understanding one’s
            career and its depictions as well as knowledge management and effort
            to achieve one’s personal desired future.

          <h2>Why is Career Development Important?</h2>
          <p class="p-text2">
            Over the years, career development has become a key element that
            organizations seek to improve their performance and productivity.
            Not only that, but career development is a notable factor in both
            employee satisfaction and retention. It affects the organization’s
            effectiveness as a whole, as career development enhances employee
            engagement, encourages open communication, and maximizes and
            improves employee skills, knowledge, and attitudes.

            A worker's emotional dedication to a company and its goals is known
            as employee engagement. Companies can increase employee retention by
            providing career development opportunities, encouraging
            organizational loyalty, and supporting workers. By implementing
            these tactics, companies can improve the work environment and
            increase employee happiness levels, ultimately improving employee
            retention rates. According to employee training statistics, 74% of
            employees are willing to take a retraining course or learn more
            skills to keep their current position and 70% of workers will at
            least be inclined to change their current employer into one that
            prioritizes employee learning and development.

            to be done, why it should be done, what to do, and how to complete
            it. The training strategy implemented in the organization is
            expected to have a good effect on improving the professional
            qualifications, understanding, and behavior of employees in the
            process of operation in order to improve their effectiveness.
            According to leadership training statistics, 56% of workforce
