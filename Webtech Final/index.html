                  <h2>What is Career Development?</h2>
                  <p>Career development describes a complicated process of planning
                    activities and engagement in one’s career to establish growth in their
                    chosen career (Serbes & Albay, 2017; Shaito, 2019). Such growth is
                    valuable to both the individual and the company as it contributes to
                    the progress of the individual in reaching their career objectives
                    through the development of their skills, capabilities,
                    decision-making, competence, and comprehension (Serbes & Albay, 2017;
                    Saleem et al., 2013). It encompasses the need for understanding one’s
                    career and its depictions as well as knowledge management and effort
                    to achieve one’s personal desired future (Mulhall, 2014; Sinha, 2020).</p>

                  <h2>Why having a Career Development is important?</h2>
                  <p>Over the years, career development has become a key element that
                    organizations seek to improve their performance and productivity
                    (Nava-Macali et al., 2019, Saleem et al., 2019). Not only that, but
                    career development is a notable factor in both employee satisfaction
                    and retention (Hedge & Rineer, 2017; Nava-Macali et al., 2019). It
                    affects the organization’s effectiveness as a whole, as career
                    development enhances employee engagement, encourages open
                    communication, and maximizes and improves employee skills, knowledge,
                    and attitudes (McDaniels & Gysbers, 1992 as cited in Chu et al., 2007;
                    Nava-Macali et al., 2019; Serbes & Albay, 2017; Shaito, 2019; Sinha,
                    2020).</p>

              <p class="statistics-p">A worker's emotional dedication to a company and its goals is known as
                employee engagement. Companies can increase employee retention by
                providing career development opportunities, encouraging organizational
                loyalty, and supporting workers. By implementing these tactics,
                companies can improve the work environment and increase employee
                happiness levels, ultimately improving employee retention rates.
                According to employee training statistics, 74% of employees are
                willing to take a retraining course or learn more skills to keep their
                current position and 70% of workers will at least be inclined to
                change their current employer into one that prioritizes employee
                learning and development.

            <p class="statistics-p1"> Employees will have the opportunity to develop their expertise,
                competencies, and strengths through training that helps them
                understand, understand and know what needs to be done, why it needs to
                be done, why it should be done, what to do, and how to complete it.
                The training strategy implemented in the organization is expected to
                have a good effect on improving the professional qualifications,
                understanding, and behavior of employees in the process of operation
                in order to improve their effectiveness. According to leadership
                training statistics, 56% of workforce management leaders, training and
                development is critical to business operations and 23% of companies
                still need a structured compliance training plan, according to
                Compliance Training Insights. Moreover, according to online training
                data, 93% of workers, employee training should be simple,
                comprehensive, personalized, and tailored to their needs.
