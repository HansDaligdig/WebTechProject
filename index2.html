            <h2 class="header2-text"
              >Career development describes a complicated process of planning
              activities and engagement in one’s career to establish growth in their
              chosen career (Serbes & Albay, 2017; Shaito, 2019). Such growth is
              valuable to both the individual and the company as it contributes to the
              progress of the individual in reaching their career objectives through
              the development of their skills, capabilities, decision-making,
              competence, and comprehension (Serbes & Albay, 2017; Saleem et al.,
              2013). It encompasses the need for understanding one’s career and its
              depictions as well as knowledge management and effort to achieve one’s
              personal desired future (Mulhall, 2014; Sinha, 2020).

            <h2 class="header2-text2"
              >Over the years, career development has become a key element that
              organizations seek to improve their performance and productivity
              (Nava-Macali et al., 2019, Saleem et al., 2019). Not only that, but
              career development is a notable factor in both employee satisfaction and
              retention (Hedge & Rineer, 2017; Nava-Macali et al., 2019). It affects
              the organization’s effectiveness as a whole, as career development
              enhances employee engagement, encourages open communication, and
              maximizes and improves employee skills, knowledge, and attitudes
              (McDaniels & Gysbers, 1992 as cited in Chu et al., 2007; Nava-Macali et
              al., 2019; Serbes & Albay, 2017; Shaito, 2019; Sinha, 2020).

        <h2 class="span-container1"
          >A worker's emotional dedication to a company and its goals is known
          as employee engagement. Companies can increase employee retention by
          providing career development opportunities, encouraging organizational
          loyalty, and supporting workers. By implementing these tactics,
          companies can improve the work environment and increase employee
          happiness levels, ultimately improving employee retention rates.
          According to employee training statistics, 74% of employees are
          willing to take a retraining course or learn more skills to keep their
          current position and 70% of workers will at least be inclined to
          change their current employer into one that prioritizes employee
          learning and development.

        <h2 class="span-container2"
          >Employees will have the opportunity to develop their expertise,
          competencies, and strengths through training that helps them
          understand, understand and know what needs to be done, why it needs to
          be done, why it should be done, what to do, and how to complete it.
          The training strategy implemented in the organization is expected to
          have a good effect on improving the professional qualifications,
          understanding, and behavior of employees in the process of operation
          in order to improve their effectiveness. According to leadership
          training statistics, 56% of workforce management leaders, training and
          development is critical to business operations and 23% of companies
          still need a structured compliance training plan, according to
          Compliance Training Insights. Moreover, according to online training
          data, 93% of workers, employee training should be simple,
          comprehensive, personalized, and tailored to their needs.
